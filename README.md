# Stock Analysis

The attached jupyter notebook files are of the Online intership done for Career Launcher (aspiration.ai).
There are 6 modules. The learnings were:

•	Did exploratory data analysis on Mahindra & Mahindra stocks data using python pandas library and calculated monthly VWAP.
•	Used seaborn and matplotlib libraries to visualize the trends and find correlations with respect to Nifty50 and other stocks.
•	Calculated stock Volatility, Performed CAPM Analysis and Beta calculation to predict future trends using OLS with scikit-learn.
•	Made trade calls using SMA and Bolinger Bands. Created a portfolio with 5 different stocks, calculated the combined Returns and Volatility with varying investment weights. Found the optimum investment weights to minimize risk and maximize profit.
•	Analysed 30 different stocks of high, medium and small capital using unsupervised learning (K-means clustering) on the basis of Volatility and Returns. Found optimum K-value for K-means using elbow curve. Clustered stocks which have similar behaviour.
